# Building

Requires [Xcode 6 or higher](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) on Mac OS X - available at [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/) after signing in with your Apple ID.

Standard Xcode project stuff: check out the repo, open Wikipedia.xcodeproj in Xcode, pick a device or simulator target and hit âŒ˜R.

Note that due to Apple's restrictions on iOS app installation, to run a custom build on a standard iOS device you must pay for a [developer account with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action) and register the device with your account.

You'll also need to install the following (used by build scripts):

* [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and npm
* grunt-cli (run 'sudo npm install -g grunt-cli') 
* [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/en/download/mac-os/)


# Filing Bugs

Please file bugs at [bugzilla.wikimedia.org](https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Wikipedia%20App); use the "iOS App" component.


# Submitting patches

See [mediawiki.org's Gerrit page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit) for general information about contributing to Wikimedia project source code hosted in Gerrit -- use the project name "apps/ios/wikipedia" in place of "mediawiki/core" etc.

You can also follow or fork from our [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/wikimedia/apps-ios-wikipedia). Note that pull requests submitted through GitHub must be manually copied over to Gerrit for review and merge (though there is a bot we plan to enable to simplify this).

Please include unit tests with any new code where possible.


# Architecture

This generation of the Wikipedia reader app is built around native UI chrome (menus, toolbars, search UI, preferences, caching, etc) to improve startup time, responsiveness and "nativey" look-n-feel versus a previous HTML-based approach using PhoneGap/Apache Cordova.

The majority of app logic and UI will be in the native layer; we expect to use the WebView component as a relatively dumb content display & event trigger layer.

Components of the app will be relatively self-contained, communicating via NSNotificationCenter as a messaging bus to avoid over-close coupling of parts and to make test-driven development more feasible.



# Development team

The app is primarily being developed by the Wikimedia Foundation's [Mobile Apps team](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Apps/Team), starting at the end of October 2013. The team operates on an "agile"-style process with 2-week sprints, and checkin scrums on Monday/Wednesday/Friday at 10:15am US Pacific Time.

In addition to a general bug pool in Bugzilla, we'll be tracking ongoing work on the [backlog board](https://trello.com/b/h0B6QYBo/mobile-app-backlog) and active sprint boards on Trello.

Volunteer contributions are welcome!

We can be reached during California office hours (and sometimes outside them) in IRC: #wikimedia-mobile on irc.freenode.net.
